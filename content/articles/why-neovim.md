I never thought that I would be a code editor enthusiast. However, once I began working at the Michigan DTMB, I realized how seriously people took it. For years, I used VSCode with no issues. I had heard of Vim and Neovim brought up in conversation, but I never gave them much thought.

Once I saw how fast my coworker Micah was at editing code, I had to jump on the Neovim train. I've been using Neovim for about 7 months now and this has been my experience. 
## Benefits of Neovim

### Speed
Speed is everything in software development. As Mark Zuckerberg has said, "Move fast and break things." With a code editor like Neovim/Vim, I never really thought using the mouse had such an impact on speed until I had been using Neovim for a few months. The keyboard-centric workflow significantly boosts productivity.

### Ability to Use Anywhere
If you are SSHed into your DigitalOcean droplet, you can use the same editor as you do coding your website. This makes it optimal for remote development environments and ensures consistency across different setups. The ability to use the same configurations and plugins on any machine is a huge advantage.

### No More File Browsing
You don't realize it, but your file browser is holding you back. In Neovim, I just press Space + FF to find files or Space + FW to find a word in a file to go to that file. It's amazingly intuitive and has saved me countless hours browsing for the right file in large projects. The efficiency in navigating files is unmatched.

### Customizability
Neovim is highly customizable. You can tailor it to fit your exact needs, whether it's through plugins, keybindings, or scripting. This allows for a personalized development environment that can adapt as your needs evolve. The vibrant plugin ecosystem offers tools for every conceivable task.

### Lightweight and Efficient
Neovim is lightweight and runs efficiently even on older hardware. This makes it a great choice for developers working on less powerful machines or who prefer a minimalistic setup. The reduced resource consumption compared to heavier IDEs can result in smoother performance.

## The Drawbacks of Neovim

Neovim is great, but there are some drawbacks.

### Time and Learning Curve
You can spend a lot of time configuring Neovim, and it can be discouraging to newcomers. Additionally, it takes a long time to internalize the keybinds. The initial learning curve can be steep and may deter those looking for an out-of-the-box solution.

### Configuration Complexity
The extensive customization options mean that setting up Neovim to fit your workflow can be complex and time-consuming. For those who prefer a more straightforward setup, this might be a drawback. The need to manually configure many aspects can be daunting.

## Conclusion

Neovim is an amazingly customizable code editor that, once you invest your time, will reap the dividends. Its speed, efficiency, and flexibility make it a powerful tool for developers who are willing to overcome its initial challenges. I highly recommend giving Neovim a try if you're looking for a highly efficient and customizable coding environment.
